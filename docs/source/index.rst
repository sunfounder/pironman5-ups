**Pironman 5 UPS Overview**

Pironman 5 UPS is the latest addition to our Pironman Raspberry Pi case series, designed exclusively for the new Raspberry Pi 5. Itâ€™s not only a powerful local network storage (UPS) system, but also a versatile personal server capable of hosting multimedia applications, game emulators, ad-blocking services, and more.

As a high-performance UPS solution, Pironman 5 UPS features:

* **Dual Network Ports**: Built-in 2.5G Ethernet port and the Raspberry Piâ€™s native Gigabit Ethernet, offering high-speed data transfer and better network performance.
* **Dual Drive Bays with RAID Support**: Supports two 3.5" or 2.5" SATA drives and allows software RAID 0 or RAID 1 configuration for flexible storage capacity and data redundancy.
* **Efficient Cooling System**: Equipped with a large 90mm fan for effective, quiet cooling of the entire system.
* **OLED Status Display**: Integrated OLED screen displays essential system stats and drive information in real-time, helping you monitor device health at a glance.
* **User-Friendly Interface Design**: Converts the micro HDMI port to a standard HDMI connector, and adds a front-access USB port for convenient device interaction.

Pironman 5 UPS is a professional-grade solution tailored for users building their own private cloud, home media center, or edge computing node.
