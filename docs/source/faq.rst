FAQ
============

How to disable web dashboard?
------------------------------------------------------

Once you have completed the installation of the ``pironman5`` module, you will be able to access the :ref:`ups_view_control_dashboard`.
      
If you do not need this feature and want to reduce CPU and RAM usage, you can disable the dashboard during the installation of ``pironman5`` by adding the ``--disable-dashboard`` flag.
      
.. code-block:: shell
      
   cd ~/pironman5
   sudo python3 install.py --disable-dashboard
      
If you have already installed ``pironman 5``, you can remove the ``dashboard`` module and ``influxdb``, then restart pironman5 to apply the changes:
      
.. code-block:: shell
      
   /opt/pironman5/env/bin/pip3 uninstall pm-dashboard influxdb
   sudo apt purge influxdb
   sudo systemctl restart pironman5


How to Control Components Using the ``pironman5`` Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You can refer to the following tutorial to control the components of the Pironman 5 using the ``pironman5`` command.

* :ref:`ups_view_control_commands`



How to Modify the Boot Order with Raspberry Pi Imager?
---------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to modifying the ``BOOT_ORDER`` in the EEPROM configuration, you can also use the **Raspberry Pi Imager** to change the boot order of your Raspberry Pi.

It is recommended to use a spare card for this step.

* :ref:`ups_update_bootloader`




OLED Screen Not Working?
--------------------------


If the OLED screen is not displaying or is displaying incorrectly, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the OLED Screen Connection**

   Ensure that the FPC cable of the OLED screen is properly connected.

2. **Check OS Compatibility**

   Make sure you are running a compatible operating system on your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Check I2C Address**

   Run the following command to check whether the OLED's I2C address (0x3C) is recognized:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo i2cdetect -y 1

   If the address is not detected, enable I2C using the following command:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo raspi-config

4. **Restart the pironman5 Service**

   Restart the `pironman5` service to see if it resolves the issue:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo systemctl restart pironman5.service

5. **Check the Log File**

   If the issue persists, check the log file for error messages and provide the information to customer support for further analysis:

   .. code-block:: shell

      cat /var/log/pironman5/pm_auto.oled.log


.. _ups_openssh_powershell:

Install OpenSSH via Powershell
-----------------------------------

When you use ``ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`` (or ``ssh <username>@<IP address>``) to connect to your Raspberry Pi, but the following error message appears.

    .. code-block::

        ssh: The term 'ssh' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the
        spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.


It means your computer system is too old and does not have `OpenSSH <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui>`_ pre-installed, you need to follow the tutorial below to install it manually.

#. Type ``powershell`` in the search box of your Windows desktop, right click on the ``Windows PowerShell``, and select ``Run as administrator`` from the menu that appears.

   .. image:: img/powershell_ssh.png
      :width: 90%
      

#. Use the following command to install ``OpenSSH.Client``.

   .. code-block::

        Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

#. After installation, the following output will be returned.

   .. code-block::

        Path          :
        Online        : True
        RestartNeeded : False

#. Verify the installation by using the following command.

   .. code-block::

        Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'

#. It now tells you that ``OpenSSH.Client`` has been successfully installed.

   .. code-block::

        Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
        State : Installed

        Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
        State : NotPresent

    .. warning:: 
        If the above prompt does not appear, it means that your Windows system is still too old, and you are advised to install a third-party SSH tool, like |link_putty|.

#. Now restart PowerShell and continue to run it as administrator. At this point you will be able to log in to your Raspberry Pi using the ``ssh`` command, where you will be prompted to enter the password you set up earlier.

If I set up OMV, can I still use the Pironman5's function?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, OpenMediaVault is set up on the Raspberry Pi system. Please follow the steps of :ref:`ups_set_up_pi_os` to continue the configuration.
