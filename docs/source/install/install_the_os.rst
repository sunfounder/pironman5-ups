3. Installing the Operating System
=======================================

.. warning::

   OpenMediaVault **does not** support installation on the Raspberry Pi OS desktop or Home Assistant OS.

   Please make sure you have installed the correct operating system and configured the network.
   The procedure here is consistent with :ref:`ups_install_os_sd_rpi`, but when selecting an image, please choose Raspberry Pi OS Lite from Raspberry Pi OS (other).

In this chapter, you will learn how to install the operating systems. All the installation steps depend on the |link_rpi_imager|, which you need to install first.
